# How to

1. Add a `LICENSE` file to your GitHub repository [as we did here](LICENSE), if you don't have one. You can read more about adding a license to the GitHub repository [here](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository).

2. In your repository, create a `CITATION.cff` file with a citation details.
    - Use [this wizard](https://citation-file-format.github.io/cff-initializer-javascript) to create a CITATION.cff file, basing on [ours](CITATION.cff) as an example (alternatively, you can customize our CITATION.cff file, but it is more convenient to use the wizard). <br />
:warning: Add the DOI identifier field and temporarily put there any DOI, you will later change it to the DOI obtained via Zenodo for your repository.
    - The format of the file is YAML
    - License: for datasets it has to be CC0 1.0. What about software? :question:
    - After commit, the citation tool will be available on the right repository panel:<br />

3. In your repository, create a `.zenodo.json` file. You can edit the [this sample one here](.zenodo.json).
   - Add your grant number in the field *"notes"* 
   <br />:warning: Polish grants **do not** work with the dedicated field "grants/funding"
   - More information on the format and fields are [available here](https://developers.zenodo.org/#introduction)
   - The format of the file is json
   - license: for data sets it has to be CC0 1.0. What about software? :question:

<br />

ðŸ“¢
**At this point, you should make your repository [publicly available](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility).**

<br />

4. Connect Zenodo to GitHub (or vice versa) as [described here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content).
   - Your GitHub settings will be available at [https://zenodo.org/account/settings/github/](https://zenodo.org/account/settings/github/).
   - Enable the integration by switching the repository on:<br />
![](obrazki/image-2023-01-02-11-50-58.png)
   - Go to GitHub and make your first [release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository) (or pre-release):<br />
![](obrazki/image-2023-01-02-11-52-51.png)<br />
![](obrazki/image-2023-01-02-11-54-11.png)
   - At this point your repository will be visible at the appropriate Zenodo page. Please note the status - green means ok, orange means processing, red means error<br />
![](obrazki/image-2023-01-02-11-55-57.png)
   - At this point you can add a repository DOI identifier issued by Zenodo to the `CITATION.cff` file (see above). See below on how to get the universal DOI

5. New DOI is generated every time you do a release (or pre-release) of your repository. To get the one-universal DOI for your repository, at the Zenodo page:
   - Move to the the GitHub panel
   - Select your repository from the Enabled Repositories panel
   - Click DOI for any of the releases, you will be redirected to the Zenodo page of your published repository
   - In the right panel, look for *Cite all versions? You can cite all versions by using the DOI...*:<br />

> **_NOTE:_**  You can also add a cool zenodo badge to your repository:

## Additional remarks and optional steps:

1. You may want to enable GitHub actions to check validity of `CITATION.cff`, as is done in this repository (`.github/workflows/cffconvert.yml`). You will get a cool badge: [![cffconvert](https://github.com/filipsPL/NCN-github-OA/actions/workflows/cffconvert.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/filipsPL/NCN-github-OA/actions/workflows/cffconvert.yml)
1. When the paper is published and has DOI assigned, you may add this info to `CITATION.cff` file in `identifiers` section.

# Unanswered questions

1. The GitHub repository has an unique DOI, and the following up, peer-reviewed scientific paper also has its own DOI. We (the scientists) want to get citations from the scientific paper. Questions:
   - shall we require others to cite both GitHub repo and scientific paper? Or only the paper?
   - if both are cited, can we merge both citations (eg in Google Scholar)?
